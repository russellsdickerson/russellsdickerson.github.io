 As part of a multidisciplinary capstone team, I developed an embedded pressure sensing device to measure dog bite force over time. This tool was designed to support injury investigations and veterinary research in Travis County Medical Examiner in Austin, Texas. The device is designed in the shape of a toy bone and force is measured through changes in pressure within an air-filled bladder within the central rod. Sensors are housed at the ends of the bone-shaped device and are protected from accidental biting. After testing, the microSD card can be accessed via a door in the protective casing, allowing the data to be uploaded to a computer for further analysis.
