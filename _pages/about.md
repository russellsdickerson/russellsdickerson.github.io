Hello! Welcome to my website.

My name is Russell and I just graduated with a masters degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan. I am now working as a graduate researcher in two research groups at the university. In the FREE lab, I am being advised by Prof. Daniel Bruder, where I am helping to design, model, and fabricate grid-based soft robotic actuators. In the Locomotor Control Systems Lab, I am being advised by Prof. Robert Gregg, where I am investigating behavioral properties of time-varying impedance control for powered prosthetic limbs.

Previously, I conducted research in the EMBiR Lab on passive thermal regulation in bio-inspired soft actuators and have contributed to materials research involving bio-based fibrous composites and fabric sensing. Moreover, my academic research is also complemented by industry research at Becton Dickinson, where I worked on mechanical test method development for a specific medical device product.

My main research interests are in the design, modeling, and control of soft robotic systems. Keeping this in mind, my long-term goal is to advance the integration of these principles, creating unified, robust, and intelligent systems. My hope is that this will lead to the widespread adoption of soft systems in our daily life.

Outside of work and research, I enjoy reading papers and marathon training in my spare time.
