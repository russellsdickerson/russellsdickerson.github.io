Hello! Welcome to my website.

My name is Russell and I am a graduate researcher in the mechanical engineering department at the University of Michigan. Prior to this, I recieved a M.Sc. in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan and a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. 

In the FREE lab, I am being advised by Prof. Daniel Bruder, where I am helping to design, model, and fabricate grid-based soft robotic actuators. In the Locomotor Control Systems Lab, I am being advised by Prof. Robert Gregg, where I am investigating behavioral properties of time-varying impedance control for powered prosthetic limbs. Previously, I have been fortunate to be advised by Prof. Talia Moore in the EMBiR Lab at the University of Michigan and Prof. Jonathan Chen in the Renewable Fiber & Composite Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. Moreover, my academic research is also complemented by one year of industry medical device research at Becton Dickinson, where I developed new mechanical testing methods for widely-used blood collection products.

My research interests include the design, modeling, and control of soft robotic systems in general and for medical applications. Keeping this in mind, my goal is to advance the integration of these principles, creating unified, robust, and intelligent systems that open the way for the widespread adoption of soft systems throughout our daily life.
