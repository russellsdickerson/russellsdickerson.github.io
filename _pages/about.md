I am a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Daniel Bruder and Prof. Robert Gregg. My research focuses on soft robotics, wearable prostheses, and bio-inspired actuation.

Currently, I design and analyze modular, grid-based soft robotic actuators in the FREE Lab, and investigate time-varying impedance control for prosthetic limbs in the Locomotor Control Systems Lab. I also previously worked on thermally adaptive soft actuators inspired by Saharan silver ants with Prof. Talia Moore.

Before graduate school, I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science minor from the University of Texas at Austin. I’ve worked as a project engineer designing mission-critical systems for data centers, and as an R&D intern at Becton Dickinson, where I proposed a new mechanical testing method currently under review for adoption.

My long-term goal is to develop robust, adaptable systems that merge control theory with compliant design to enhance human mobility and interaction.
