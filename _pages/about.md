B.S. Mechanical Engineering with Minor in Computer Science, University of Texas at Austin

Hello! I am a graduate researcher in mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan with interests in the design, modeling, and control of soft robotics, compliant actuation and locomotion, and medical soft robotics. I approach soft robotics as an intrinsically multidisciplinary field, where actuation, morphology, sensing and control must be developed simultaneously. Further, I am motivated by the challenge of integrating structural design with embodied intelligence, and control-theoretic principles into unified, deployable systems that are capable of achieving robustness in uncertain and unstructured environments.

Currently, I am working in two research groups at the University of Michigan. In the FREE lab, I am being advised by Prof. Daniel Bruder, where I am helping to design, model, and fabricate grid-based soft robotic actuators. In the Locomotor Control Systems Lab, I am being advised by Prof. Robert Gregg, where I am investigating behavioral properties of time-varying impedance control for powered prosthetic limbs.

Previously, I have conducted research in the EMBiR Lab on passive thermal regulation in soft actuators structurally inspired by Saharan silver ants and have contributed to materials research involving bio-based fibrous composites and fabric sensing. Additionally, my academic research is complemented by industry research at Becton Dickinson, where I worked on mechanical test method development for a specific medical device.

Moreover, my long-term research goal is to advance the integration of intelligent design, modeling, and control for soft robotics, leading to the widespread adoption of soft systems in our daily life.

Outside of school and research, I like to train for marathons in my spare time.
