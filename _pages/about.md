Hello! My name is Russell and I just graduated with a masters degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan. Now I am working as a graduate researcher in two research groups at the university. In the FREE lab, I am being advised by Prof. Daniel Bruder, where I am helping to design, model, and fabricate grid-based soft robotic actuators. In the Locomotor Control Systems Lab, I am being advised by Prof. Robert Gregg, where I am investigating behavioral properties of time-varying impedance control for powered prosthetic limbs.

Previously, I have conducted research in the EMBiR Lab on passive thermal regulation in soft actuators structurally inspired by Saharan silver ants and have contributed to materials research involving bio-based fibrous composites and fabric sensing. Additionally, my academic research is complemented by industry research at Becton Dickinson, where I worked on mechanical test method development for a specific medical device.

My main research interests are in the design, modeling, and control of soft robotics, compliant actuation and locomotion, and medical soft robotics. Moreover, my long-term research goal is to advance the integration of intelligent design, modeling, and control of soft robotics, leading to the widespread adoption of soft systems in our daily life.

Outside of work and research, I like to train for marathons in my spare time.

<!--I approach soft robotics as an intrinsically multidisciplinary field, where actuation, morphology, sensing and control must be developed simultaneously. Further, I am motivated by the challenge of integrating structural design with embodied intelligence, and control-theoretic principles into unified, deployable systems that are capable of achieving robustness in uncertain and unstructured environments.-->
