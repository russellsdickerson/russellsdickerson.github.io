## Fabric-Based Pouch Grid Actuator (In Progress)<span style="float:right"><em>Apr 2025 – Present</em></span>  
*FREE Lab, University of Michigan*  
This aim of this project is to create modular, grid-based soft robotic actuators that enable scalable and programmable behaviors. As this project is still in progress, I will update this section upon its completion.

## Stability Guarantees for Variable Impedance Control (In Progress)<span style="float:right"><em>Apr 2025 – Present</em></span>  
*Locomotor Control Systems Lab, University of Michigan*  
This project investigates how powered prosthetic limbs can safely adapt to real-world interactions using time-varying impedance controllers. I modeled a 3-DOF limb and applied Lyapunov-based analysis to provide theoretical safety guarantees, which is a crucial step toward robust and responsive HRI.

## Bio-Inspired Thermal Regulation in Soft Actuators <span style="float:right"><em>Jan 2024 – May 2024</em></span>  
*EMBiR Lab, University of Michigan*  
Inspired by the Saharan silver ant, I developed a soft actuator that passively scatters infrared radiation to reduce thermal load. The system demonstrated a 15°F improvement in passive thermal regulation under IR exposure, suggesting a new direction for designing thermally resilient soft systems.

## Embedded Pressure Sensing for Animal Bite Force Measurement <span style="float:right"><em>Jan 2020 – May 2020</em></span>  
*Senior Design Project, Travis County Medical Examiner’s Office*  
As part of a multidisciplinary capstone team, I developed an embedded pressure sensing device to measure bite force in canines. This tool was designed to support injury investigations and veterinary research, and included mechanical design, signal acquisition, and field-ready housing.
