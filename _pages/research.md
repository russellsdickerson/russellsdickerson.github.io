## Fabric-Based Pouch Grid Actuator (In Progress)<span style="float:right"><em>Apr 2025 – Present</em></span>  
*FREE Lab, University of Michigan*  
This aim of this project is to create modular, grid-based soft robotic actuators that enable scalable and programmable behaviors. As this project is still in progress, I will update this section upon its completion.

## Stability Guarantees for Variable Impedance Control (In Progress)<span style="float:right"><em>Apr 2025 – Present</em></span>  
*Locomotor Control Systems Lab, University of Michigan*  
This project investigates how powered prosthetic limbs can safely adapt to real-world interactions using time-varying impedance controllers. I modeled a 3-DOF limb and applied Lyapunov-based analysis to provide theoretical safety guarantees, which is a crucial step toward robust and responsive HRI.

## Bio-Inspired Thermal Regulation in Soft Actuators <span style="float:right"><em>Jan 2024 – May 2024</em></span>  
*EMBiR Lab, University of Michigan*  
Inspired by the Saharan silver ant, I developed a soft actuator that passively scatters infrared radiation to reduce thermal load. The system demonstrated a 15°F improvement in passive thermal regulation under IR exposure, suggesting a new direction for designing thermally resilient soft systems.
