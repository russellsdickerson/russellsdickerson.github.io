Research Experience
======
**FREE Lab, University of Michigan**   
*Graduate Student Researcher*<span style="float:right; font-weight:normal"><em>Apr 2025 – Present</em></span>  
*Advisor: Prof. Daniel Bruder*
  - Designed, modeled, and fabricated modular, grid-based, soft robotic actuators for compliant systems, investigating their
 mechanical behavior, manufacturability, and applicability in various compliant actuation systems.

**Locomotor Control Systems Lab, University of Michigan**  
*Graduate Student Researcher*<span style="float:right; font-weight:normal"><em>Apr 2025 – Present</em></span>  
*Advisor: Prof. Robert Gregg*  
  * Investigated stability of time-varying impedance control for robotic prostheses using Lyapunov-based analysis.
  * Modeled a 3-DOF powered prosthetic limb system and provided theoretical safety guarantees, supporting the
 development of robust controllers for wearable robotics in dynamic environments.

**Becton Dickinson**  
*Product Development Engineer I / R&D Intern*<span style="float:right; font-weight:normal"><em>Jun 2024 – Present</em></span>
  * Proposed and validated a novel mechanical, destructive test method for a BD product line, reducing sample sizes by 33%
 and improving testing efficiency; results presented at an R&D symposium are under consideration for official adoption.
  * Conducted an extensive literature review on the current state of blood processing.
  * Authored technical reports evaluating product feasibility and stability, incorporating statistical analysis of mechanical test
 data to identify trends and ensure compliance with specifications.

**EMBiR Lab, University of Michigan**  
*Graduate Student Researcher*<span style="float:right; font-weight:normal"><em>Jan 2024 – May 2024</em></span>  
*Advisor: Prof. Talia Y. Moore*  
  * Designed and fabricated a Saharan silver ant–inspired, soft robotic actuator that possesses wave scattering properties and
 demonstrates a 15°F improved passive thermal regulation compared to the control under IR exposure.

**Renewable Fiber & Composite Lab, University of Texas at Austin**  
*Undergraduate Research Assistant*<span style="float:right; font-weight:normal"><em>Apr 2019 – Aug 2019</em></span>  
*Advisor: Prof. Jonathan Y. Chen*  
  * Manufactured bio-based fiber and fibrous composite materials that supported research into fabric sensing applications.
