## Overview
The Saharan silver ant survives extreme desert temperatures through an unique thermoregulatory adaptation involving a dense array of triangular hairs covering its dorsal and lateral body surfaces. These hairs exhibit a specialized cross-section with corrugated top facets and a flat bottom facet, enabling strong broadband reflectivity in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum via Mie scattering and total internal reflection—significantly reducing solar heat absorption. Simultaneously, in the mid-infrared (MIR) range, where solar radiation is negligible and thermal emission dominates, the hairs enhance emissivity by acting as a gradient refractive index layer, promoting efficient blackbody radiation and heat dissipation. Experimental measurements confirm that hair-covered regions reflect up to 67% of incident solar radiation and increase MIR emissivity by approximately 15%, resulting in lower steady-state body temperatures. Additionally, the absence of hairs on the ant’s ventral side minimizes heat gain from the hot desert floor. Together, these optical and thermal mechanisms allow the ants to maintain body temperatures below their critical thermal limit and sustain foraging activity in environments reaching up to 70 °C, while offering a biologically inspired model for passive radiative cooling technologies.

## Design
Inspired by the structure of the surface hairs on Saharan silver ants, I researched if soft actuators that share this geometry would also passively scatter infrared radiation and reduce thermal load. The system demonstrated a 15°F improvement in passive thermal regulation under IR exposure, suggesting a new direction for designing thermally resilient soft systems.
The final design will consist of a soft robotic system capable of actively switching between a circular cross-section while inflated and a triangular one while deflated. The triangular structure was theorized

To mold the EcoFlex, 3D-printed molds to form the EcoFlex into our desired final design configuration have been modeled as seen in figures 3 and 4. The testing setup requires three individual models per surface. Since two different conditions are being tested, six total EcoFlex models are required. Because of this, it is proposed that six 3D-printed molds will be made. Due to the properties of Ecoflex, a release agent is required for the molding to ensure the final design remains intact. A syringe will be used to inflate and deflate the EcoFlex model into different shapes. With the two testing surfaces, two syringe quad connectors will be needed to ensure two design configurations can be tested simultaneously for the circular form and the triangular form. This will help regulate the baseline temperature to be the same. With the six individual EcoFlex models, six tubings will be required to inflate and deflate all of them simultaneously. These tubings will connect the quad connector to each individual model. The tissue boxes will be used as a low-cost solution for the testing set-up. A parachute material will be attached on the top side of the tissue boxes to simulate the chosen application of thermal regulation for a tent. A thermometer will be placed inside the tissue box to measure the temperatures of each individual testing setup. In addition to the setups for the triangular and circular forms, a third control testing setup will be added without the EcoFlex model on top of it. Therefore, three IR lamps will be needed to ensure consistency in the type and quantity of heating that arrives at the testing models simultaneously. This setup will be more accurate than a single lamp for all three testing setups because the centrally placed box would absorb more heat than the testing setups on either side.
